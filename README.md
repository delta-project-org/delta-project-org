This is the Delta Project, aiming to improve software reliability.

First and foremost is managing software properties such as memory and CPU usage bounds, or properties of data objects.
The programmer states them in the form of assertions, the compiler verifies. Runtime-checking is the fallback of last resort if static verification is impossible.
