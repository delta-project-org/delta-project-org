# We currently have two kinds of labels: priority labels and need labels.
# Need labels indicate what needs to be done next, and their color indicates
# which group of contributors should do it. They are prefixed with "Needs:"
# Priority labels indicate heightened urgency. They are prefixed with "Prio:"

color_definitions:
# Colors are picked up via their anchors (things that start with &).
# Their presence inside of color_definitions does not matter.

  - &alertColor 'ff0000'
  # Confirmed high priority.
  # Brightest possible red.

  - &pendingColor 'f98100'
  # Something took too long and now requires attention.
  # Orange - that's almost red but not quite.

  - &submitterColor '006aec'
  # Submitter needs to take an action.
  # Color between blue (calm) and green (relaxed):
  # we want to set a relaxed and easygoing mood for them.

  - &reviewerColor '800080'
  # Reviewer needs to take an action.
  # "Less aggressive than red, but more active than blue." (Wikipedia)

  - &inactiveColor 'D2DAE1'
  # No more activity required on this.
  # Grey/white to avoid drawing attention.

  - &topicColor 'BFD4F2'
  # General area of interest within the project.

labels:
  # Each label is a key-dict pair.
  # The key is the name to use for the label on GitHub.
  # The dict entries are interpreted as follows:
  #   color: Background color to display the label in on GitHub
  #   text: Explanatory text for the label to supply to GitHub
  #         (currently not supported by the GitHub API but this may come)
  #   can-add: List of groups that have permissions to add that label
  #   can-remove: List of groups that have permissions to remove that label
  #   Two special permission groups exist:
  #   - EVERYONE people with read access to the repository
  #   - SUBMITTER the person who opened the PR/issue being processed
